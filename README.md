# Tour Guide App Project

Sixth Project for Udacity Android Basics Nanodegree by Google.

The goal was to create a tour guide app which presents relevant information to a user whoâ€™s visiting a city of my choice.
This is an app with multiple screens, each of which lists top attractions, restaurants, public places, or events for the city.
